---

## Part 2: Data Format Mismatch Analysis

### Founders' Expected Input Format (Transaction-Level)

```csv
date,total,customer_id,item_name,day_of_week
2025-10-01,45.50,C001,Burger,Monday
2025-10-01,32.00,C002,Salad,Monday
2025-10-01,67.25,C001,Steak,Monday  # Repeat customer
```

**Key characteristics:**
- One row per transaction
- Customer-level tracking (customer_id)
- Item-level detail (item_name)
- Enables repeat customer calculation
- Enables item-level sales analysis
- Enables day-of-week patterns

### Our Current Input Format (Aggregated Daily)

```csv
date,cuisine_type,dining_model,avg_ticket,covers,labor_cost_pct,food_cost_pct,table_turnover,sales_per_sqft,expected_customer_repeat_rate
2025-09-01,American,Full Service,35.0,178,30.0,29.6,2.6,610,0.4
```

**Key characteristics:**
- One row per day
- Pre-aggregated metrics
- No transaction detail
- No customer tracking
- No item-level data
- Cannot calculate repeat rate (it's an input)
- Cannot identify specific slow days

---

## Part 3: Critical Gaps Identified

### Gap #1: Transaction-Level Data Processing
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Cannot perform core analyses from original challenge

**What's Missing:**
- No ability to ingest transaction-level CSV data
- No customer_id tracking
- No item_name analysis
- No day-of-week pattern detection at transaction level

**Why It Matters:**
The Founders' challenge was designed to test **data aggregation and analysis** skills. Our current implementation skips this by accepting pre-aggregated data.

---

### Gap #2: Slowest Day Analysis
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Requirement:** "Find the slowest day of the week - by transaction count and by revenue"

**What's Missing:**
- No day-of-week aggregation
- No identification of weakest days
- No transaction count analysis
- No revenue-by-day analysis

**Current Data Limitation:**
Our daily aggregated format includes `date` but we don't extract `day_of_week` or analyze patterns across weekdays.

---

### Gap #3: Customer Loyalty Calculation
**Severity:** MAJOR
**Requirement:** "Calculate percentage of repeat customers"

**What's Missing:**
- No customer_id tracking
- No repeat customer identification
- No calculation of loyalty rate

**Current Implementation:**
- We accept `expected_customer_repeat_rate` as an INPUT
- This should be a CALCULATED OUTPUT from transaction data

**Mismatch:**
The Founders wanted to see ability to aggregate customer purchase history and calculate loyalty. We're treating it as a given metric instead.

---

### Gap #4: Item-Level Sales Analysis
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Requirement:** "Identify top 3 and bottom 3 selling items by revenue and quantity"

**What's Missing:**
- No item_name field
- No item-level revenue tracking
- No quantity tracking
- No product mix analysis

**Current Data:**
Our CSV format has no item-level granularity whatsoever.

---

### Gap #5: Day-Specific Recommendations
**Severity:** MODERATE
**Requirement:** "Actionable recommendations like 'Run midweek promotion on Wednesdays'"

**What's Missing:**
- Our recommendations are generic: "Increase Quantity of Sales" or "Boost AOV"
- No day-specific insights
- No temporal pattern recognition

**Current Implementation:**
- Recommendations are mapped to KPI gaps
- Not tied to specific days or times
- More strategic than tactical

---

## Part 4: Data Architecture Divergence

### Why Did We Diverge?

**Original Challenge Focus:**
- Transaction-level analytics
- Single-restaurant, granular insights
- Data aggregation skills test

**Our MVP Focus:**
- Benchmark comparison
- Industry peer analysis
- Deal recommendation engine
- Multi-restaurant platform

**Result:**
We built a **strategic diagnostic platform** instead of a **tactical sales analyzer**.

---

## Part 11: Questions for Founders

Before implementing, clarify:

1. **Data Priority:** Should transaction analytics be primary or secondary to benchmark analysis?
2. **Integration:** Should both data formats coexist, or replace aggregated with transaction-level?
3. **Scope:** Stick to exact challenge specs, or expand to additional transaction insights?
4. **Timeline:** Is this needed before pilot, or can it be added in Phase 2?

---

## Conclusion

**Current State:**
Our MVP is a sophisticated benchmark comparison and deal recommendation platform that **exceeds** the Founders' original challenge in strategic capabilities but **lacks** the granular, transaction-level analytics specified in the original requirements.

**Gap:**
We need to add transaction-level data processing to calculate:
- Slowest days (by transactions and revenue)
- Actual customer loyalty rate (not just input)
- AOV breakdowns (overall and by day)
- Item-level rankings (top/bottom sellers)
- Day-specific tactical recommendations

**Recommended Path:**
Add parallel transaction analytics module (~10 hours) to complement existing benchmark system. This creates a complete platform with both strategic and tactical capabilities.

**Next Steps:**
1. Get approval on recommended approach
2. Implement transaction analyzer module
3. Create sample transaction data
4. Add new dashboard tab
5. Update documentation
6. Test with realistic data
7. Deploy for pilot testing
