Flavyr Technical Roadmap

Vision

Flavyr is building a data-driven platform that diagnoses restaurant performance issues, recommends data-backed promotions, and quantifies their causal impact, turning restaurant operations into an evidence-based system for growth.

The product evolves across four major phases, beginning with simple benchmarking and scaling toward intelligent automation.

CTO Bio

Nicolo Pastrone is a data solutions strategist with an academic background in Data Science, Economics, and Finance, and 2+ years of professional experience applying data-driven solutions to business, policy, and research problems. 

Nicolo began his career in Washington, DC as an economic policy analyst, where his research has been cited in Congressional testimony and publications including The Wall Street Journal. He also spent a semester studying in Shanghai, China, working with the marketing team of Znshine Solar to redesign ineffective data pipelines.

Since graduating in May 2025, Nicolo has worked as an independent data consultant, collaborating on research with a Yale economist, rebuilding the data systems of a social enterprise, and launching his own relationship management app, Kinect.

He’s strongest in early-phase system design and model development (Phases 1-2 of the roadmap) and is continuing to develop expertise in production-level infrastructure and product scaling (Phases 3-4).

Timeline

(Conservative estimates based on one developer working 10-20 hours/week using AI tools)

These durations assume steady part-time work and minimal blockers; delays in data access (especially lack of sales/beta testers/restaurant partnerships) may extend them. 

Phase 1 – Benchmarking (MVP): ~4-6 weeks development time – Functional prototype; pilot with 3–5 restaurants; dashboard feedback. Shoot for end of November/early December launch.

Phase 2 – Smart Clustering: ~12–20 weeks development time – Clustering model and UX validation. Modeling capabilities dependent on data collection & pilot success. Shoot for Q1/early Q2 2026 feature implementation.

Phase 3 – Deal Impact Measurement: ~8-12 weeks development time – Baseline forecasting and uplift modeling once live data accumulates. Shoot for Q2 2026 feature implementation.

Phase 4 – Integration & Automation: ~12–20 weeks development time – POS integration, backend transition, building scalable infrastructure. Shoot for Q3 2026 launch.

Phase 1 — Industry Benchmarking (MVP)

Purpose: Establish a baseline diagnostic layer before large-scale data collection.

Objective: Collect and standardize basic performance data by cuisine and dining model (e.g., Mexican, fast casual, full service) so restaurants can see how they stack up against peers.

Key Steps:

1. Data Collection:
   - Research data sources and gather industry benchmarks on 8–12 key metrics (e.g., revenue per seat, labor %, food %, table turnover, average check, etc.).
   - Learn what defines restaurant success and what KPIs are typically tracked.

2. Software Design:
   - Input: Restaurant type (cuisine, dining model) + CSV upload with basic KPIs.
   - Output: Dashboard/report highlighting performance gaps and underperforming metrics ranked by importance. Include suggested deal types that address each operational issue.

3. Tools & Hosting:
   - Use Streamlit or a similar low-cost web framework for the prototype.
   - Store uploaded CSVs locally or in a lightweight SQL database.

4. Questions to Answer:
   - How was the deal bank curated, and how could it be improved?
   - How much accuracy should we expect given restaurant variability?

Note on Data Sources:

Initial benchmark data will be collected from online sources and data obtained from pilot programs, including:

- National Restaurant Association – Restaurant Performance Index (sales, traffic, etc.)

- Baker Tilly Annual Restaurant Benchmarks Report (financial and operational KPIs)

- NetSuite benchmark summaries (food cost %, labor %, prime cost)

- Public library industry guides for restaurant statistics

- Pilot restaurant partners providing anonymized operational data

Outcome: A functional prototype demonstrating value through analytics and benchmark-based recommendations. After prototype completion, conduct a small pilot with 3–5 restaurants to collect feedback on dashboard usability, KPI relevance, and deal recommendation clarity. Incorporate this feedback into the next iteration before scaling. Data sources will include a mix of public benchmark data, manual inputs from pilot users, and synthetic data to simulate performance gaps.

Phase 2 — Smart Clustering (Enhanced MVP)

Purpose: Move from static benchmarks to personalized, data-driven peer groupings.

Objective: Cluster restaurants by operational similarity to produce more accurate comparisons and recommendations.

Key Steps:

1. Data Collection:
   - Accumulate operational data from restaurant partners and/or POS integrations.
   - Collect metrics sufficient to model similarity across multiple dimensions.

2. Model Development:
   - Research and test clustering algorithms (likely K-Means or similar unsupervised models).
   - Train on normalized data to form clusters of similar restaurants.

3. Software Design:
   - Input: Restaurant data upload or POS-linked data.
   - Process: Model automatically assigns restaurant to a cluster based on similarities.
   - Output: Updated dashboard with cluster-based benchmarking and tailored deal suggestions.

4. Questions to Answer:
   - What scale of data is required to train meaningful clusters?
   - Are there privacy or cost constraints in sourcing this data?

Note on UX Considerations:

Interpretability will be key for adoption. The clustering dashboard should clearly communicate performance groupings and recommendations. Consulting a UX designer or researcher during this phase will help refine the user experience and ensure the interface remains intuitive for non-technical users.

Outcome: Intelligent benchmarking with adaptive deal recommendations that improve as data volume grows. Before advancing to Phase 3, validate clustering accuracy using internal metrics (e.g., silhouette score) and qualitative feedback from pilot users. Ensure sufficient data diversity and confirm clusters align with intuitive restaurant groupings.

Phase 3 — Deal Impact Measurement (Powerful Prototype)

Purpose: Quantify how much each deal or intervention actually moves the needle on revenue and profit.

Objective: Develop causal models to measure and visualize the real-world effects of each promotion.

Key Steps:

1. Baseline Forecasting:
   - Build models to predict expected revenue under “normal” (no deal) conditions.

2. Causal Inference Modeling:
   - Apply methods such as uplift modeling, causal forests, or difference-in-differences to estimate treatment effects.

3. Visualization:
   - Integrate results into an analytics dashboard showing incremental revenue, ROI, and performance variance across deal types.

4. Questions to Answer:
   - Should this be part of the MVP or a later-stage feature?
   - What level of statistical reliability do we need before public deployment?

Outcome: Verified, data-driven measurement of promotion effectiveness. Phase 3 development should begin only once at least 3–6 months of live performance data is available from pilot restaurants. Model validation will include uplift accuracy, holdout testing, and confidence interval estimation for causal effects.

Phase 4 — Integration & Automation (Prototype  Scalable Product)

Purpose: Unify all product capabilities into a seamless, self-updating ecosystem.

Objective: Connect directly to restaurant systems for automated data ingestion, real-time deal recommendations, and continuous learning.

Key Steps:

1. API Integration:
   - Connect with major POS systems (Square, Toast, Clover), and potentially QuickBooks for transaction-level data, allowing bi-directional data synchronization (downloading POS data and uploading deal recommendations). 
   - Evaluate cost and feasibility of each integration.
   - Determine whether CSV ingestion can serve as an interim solution.

2. Productization:
   - Build a multi-user system where restaurants can create accounts, save data, and track performance over time.
   - Automate periodic model retraining as new data is collected.

3. Infrastructure:
   - Decide on scalable data storage and hosting solutions balancing cost and performance.

4. Questions to Answer:
   - What’s the long-term vision for the end-user experience?
   - Which integrations are critical versus optional for early traction?

Note on Security & Compliance:

At launch, Flavyr will operate within New York City. U.S. data privacy and state-level standards must be considered. Key next steps:
- Research POS API security requirements (authentication, encryption, access control)
- Implement basic protections during prototype hosting (SSL, authentication, data anonymization)
- Conduct further research during Phase 4 and seek advisor or contractor guidance before commercial deployment.

Outcome: A fully integrated system capable of automated deal generation, tracking, and optimization. Integration will begin with one POS system (Square) before expanding to others. The product will transition from a Streamlit-based prototype to a FastAPI backend with a React or similar web frontend once user growth and reliability demands increase. Early deployment will focus on one market segment (small multi-location chains) for stability testing.

Hurdles & Bottlenecks

Phase 1 — Industry Benchmarking

- Data Limitations: Public benchmarks are inconsistent, and universal KPIs may lack precision across cuisines and formats.

- Accuracy Risk: Restaurant variability limits early model accuracy; pilot feedback will be key for calibration.

- User Friction: Manual CSV uploads may slow adoption; templates or simplified input tools can mitigate this.

Phase 2 — Smart Clustering

- Data Scale: Clustering requires substantial and diverse data; partner onboarding may take time.

- Privacy Constraints: Some restaurants may restrict data sharing, impacting model precision.

- Interpretability: Clusters must be made intuitive to non-technical users through clear visualization and UX design.

Phase 3 — Deal Impact Measurement

- Data Maturity: Causal models depend on months of live deal data before training is viable.

- Reliability: Small sample sizes or inconsistent inputs may limit statistical confidence.

- Complexity: Models like causal forests are computationally intensive; results must remain interpretable for business users.

Phase 4 — Integration & Automation

- API Access: POS APIs require approval and vary in format, adding time and cost.

- Scaling: Moving from Streamlit to a production stack (FastAPI + React) introduces infrastructure and DevOps challenges.

- Maintenance: Data drift, API versioning, and retraining need automated monitoring to avoid technical debt.

Cross-Phase Risks

- Resourcing: Limited engineering bandwidth may constrain later phases.

- Data Governance: Schema consistency and privacy standards must be enforced across all stages.

- Scope Creep: Building predictive or advanced features too early could slow progress on validating the core benchmarking and clustering systems. The focus should stay on getting the foundational product working and tested before expanding.

Resource Plan

Nicolo Pastrone (CTO): Leads data architecture, modeling, and prototype front-end development during Phases 1–2, with regular consultation and feedback loops with other Co-Founders. Potential additions:
- UX Researcher/Designer (Contract or Advisor): Engaged early for dashboard usability and pilot feedback design.
- Backend/DevOps Support (Contract or Advisor): Added during Phase 4 for backend migration, CI/CD, and infrastructure scaling.
- Future Hiring: Additional engineer or data specialist once scaling begins and user base expands.

Data Schema & Validation Framework

To ensure data quality, interoperability, and model performance, the following schema and validation standards will be adopted across all phases.

Data Schema

Each restaurant entry should include standardized variables such as:
- avg_ticket
- covers
- labor_cost_pct
- food_cost_pct
- table_turnover
- sales_per_sqft
- promo_type
- promo_duration
- deal_revenue_uplift
- customer_repeat_rate

This schema will serve as the initial foundation for consistent benchmarking and model training, but will be reevaluated at each phase of development.

Validation Framework

Model validation will be incorporated at every stage:
- Phase 1: Compare benchmark accuracy against public data sources.
- Phase 2: Evaluate cluster cohesion (silhouette score) and human interpretability.
- Phase 3: Use holdout data and uplift accuracy for causal inference testing.
- Phase 4: Monitor retsraining stability and data drift with automated tests.

Commercial Validation & Pilot Testing

Each major product milestone will include a commercial validation step to test user adoption, pricing feasibility, and product-market fit.

- Pilot Programs: Deploy prototypes to a small set of restaurants (3–10) and gather feedback on ease of use and perceived value.

- Pricing Tests: Experiment with tiered pricing to evaluate willingness to pay.

- User Feedback Loop: Incorporate structured user interviews and surveys after each iteration.

- Adoption Metrics: Track engagement (logins, report views, active deal recommendations) to evaluate traction before scaling.
