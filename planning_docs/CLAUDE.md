# Planning Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains all planning, architecture, and roadmap documentation for the FLAVYR MVP project.

## Files in This Directory

### Core Planning Documents

- **[principles.md](principles.md)** - NON-NEGOTIABLE project rules. READ THIS FIRST before any development work.

- **[FLAVYR_Technical_Roadmap_Final.md](FLAVYR_Technical_Roadmap_Final.md)** - Complete 4-phase product roadmap with timeline, resource plan, and validation framework. Includes CTO bio and commercial validation strategy.

- **[FLAVYR_MVP_System_Architecture_Phase1.md](FLAVYR_MVP_System_Architecture_Phase1.md)** - High-level system architecture for Phase 1, including data flow diagram and component breakdown.

- **[FLAVYR_Phase1_Technical_Plan_Natural_Language.md](FLAVYR_Phase1_Technical_Plan_Natural_Language.md)** - Detailed Phase 1 implementation guide written in plain language. Use this for step-by-step development.

- **FLAVYR_Technical_Roadmap_Final.pdf** - PDF version of the technical roadmap (reference only).

## How to Use These Documents

### Starting Development
1. Read [principles.md](principles.md) - understand non-negotiable rules
2. Review [FLAVYR_MVP_System_Architecture_Phase1.md](FLAVYR_MVP_System_Architecture_Phase1.md) - understand system design
3. Follow [FLAVYR_Phase1_Technical_Plan_Natural_Language.md](FLAVYR_Phase1_Technical_Plan_Natural_Language.md) - implement week by week

### Making Decisions
- Always reference [principles.md](principles.md) for coding standards
- Check [FLAVYR_Technical_Roadmap_Final.md](FLAVYR_Technical_Roadmap_Final.md) for context on future phases
- Don't over-engineer - Phase 1 is intentionally simple

### Understanding Scope
Phase 1 focuses on:
- CSV upload and validation
- Benchmark comparison
- Gap analysis
- Deal recommendations
- Streamlit dashboard + reports

Clustering, causal modeling, and POS integration come in later phases.

## Key Takeaways

- **Keep it simple** - Phase 1 is a functional prototype, not production software
- **Beginner-friendly code** - readable by non-experts
- **No emojis** - professional appearance only
- **Python + Streamlit + SQLite** - tech stack is fixed for MVP
- **4-6 week timeline** - move fast but stay organized
