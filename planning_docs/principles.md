## NON-NEGOTIABLE PROJECT RULES - READ FIRST

**These rules MUST be followed for ALL work on this project:**

1. **Always use Python for all development in the MVP phase**
2. **Leverage Streamlit for the front-end**
3. **Write beginner-friendly code** - code must be readable and understandable by a beginner Python programmer
4. **Always take the simplest route to solving problems**
5. **The entire app should be "vibe-coder friendly"** - prioritize clarity over cleverness
6. **Make autonomous decisions** - avoid asking for user permissions unless making dangerous changes
7. **Minimize the size of the code base** - keep the project simple with fewer files when possible
8. **Avoid duplicating code**
9. **Refer to markdown files for context consistently**
10. **Do not be afraid to ask the user for questions or clarifications**
11. **NEVER use emojis in the app** - emojis make everything look AI-generated and unprofessional
12. **Every folder MUST have its own CLAUDE.md file** - context is vital; each directory needs documentation explaining its purpose, contents, and how it fits into the project
