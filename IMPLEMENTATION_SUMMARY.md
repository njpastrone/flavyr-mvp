- 11 screenshots captured across all pages
- Both empty and data-loaded states tested
- 11 UX issues identified and categorized by severity
- Initial UX rating: 7/10

### Top 5 Fixes Implemented

#### Fix #1: PDF Generation Bug (CRITICAL) ✓
**Problem:** PDF generation failed with FPDFException due to insufficient margins
**Solution:**
- Added proper margin configuration to FlavyrReport class (`__init__` method)
- Set left/right margins to 15mm, top margin to 20mm
- Added auto page break with 15mm bottom margin
- Wrapped PDF generation in try-except with user-friendly error messages
**Impact:** Core reporting feature now fully functional

#### Fix #2: Sidebar Status Indicators (HIGH) ✓
**Problem:** Conflicting status messages reported
**Solution:**
- Verified existing implementation is correct (if/else conditional)
- Status properly updates based on session state
**Impact:** Clear, non-contradictory user feedback

#### Fix #3: Loading Indicators (HIGH) ✓
**Problem:** No visual feedback during data processing
**Solution:**
- Enhanced spinner message: "Processing your restaurant data..."
- Added navigation guidance after successful processing
- Improved success messaging with actionable next steps
**Impact:** Better perceived performance and user confidence

#### Fix #4: Performance Gap Chart Scale (MEDIUM-HIGH) ✓
**Problem:** Extreme outliers (2714%) made other metrics unreadable
**Solution:**
- Separated outliers (>100% gap) from normal gaps
- Normal gaps display in readable horizontal bar chart
- Outliers shown separately as metric cards with context
- Added helpful tooltips explaining exceptional performance
**Impact:** Chart now provides actionable insights

#### Fix #5: Empty State Navigation (MEDIUM) ✓
**Problem:** Empty states lacked guidance and call-to-action

  - **Other Areas for Improvement** - Displayed in scrollable format with full details visible
- Generate fallback recommendations for top 3 gaps without specific deal matches
- Critical Issues section always visible with classification note
- Removed dropdowns from "Other" section for better scannability

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `recommendations_page()` in `app.py`
- Imported `KPI_TO_PROBLEM` mapping from recommender module
- Enhanced recommendation display logic to ensure top 3 issues always shown

**Impact:**
